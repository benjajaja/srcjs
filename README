srcjs - Source Dedicated Server JavaScript Console Interface

Copyright 2011 Benjamin Grosse <ste3ls@gmail.com>

See "LICENSE" file for mor info.

You can start and stop a source dedicated server, watch its output, and enter input.
If node or the app crashes, the stdout/stdin connection to the server process is
lost, but you can still restart it.
It should probably work for any other game server, or program, that logs to stdout
and listens to stdin.
